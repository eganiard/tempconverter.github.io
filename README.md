I had fun doing this project. It was fairly hard to figure out what was going wrong with the code at first but I got around to it in the end. I learned a lot from this exercise and I hope to improve my skills in programming and making repositories.

Heres also a Qrcode that can take you to the site from a mobile aswell.
